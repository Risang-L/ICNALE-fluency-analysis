# Cross-Country Fluency Analysis Using Whisper & ICNALE Spoken Corpus

This project analyzes second-language English fluency across countries using the ICNALE Spoken Monologue dataset and OpenAI Whisper. I extract segment-level features such as speaking rate and pause duration, and compare fluency profiles across L2 backgrounds.

## Average Words Per Second vs. Pause Duration (by Country)
This scatterplot compares speaking rate (X-axis) and average pause length (Y-axis) across countries using data from the ICNALE Spoken Monologue corpus.

Insights:

ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ Japanese and ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· Korean learners tend to speak slower and pause longer, suggesting greater planning time or hesitation during speech.

ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ Filipino, ðŸ‡µðŸ‡° Pakistani, and ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡° Hong Kong speakers demonstrate fast and fluent speech with short pauses, comparable to or exceeding native English speakers (ENS).

ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ Singaporean speakers show the highest speaking rate, though with slightly longer pauses than ENS â€” possibly reflecting fast, chunked delivery patterns.

ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© Indonesian and ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ Chinese learners display moderate fluency, with varying pause behavior.

ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­ Thai and ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼ Taiwanese learners sit near the middle range of fluency and pausing.

This plot helps visualize cross-linguistic fluency differences, with ENS serving as a native benchmark for pause efficiency and tempo.
